Class Feedback

What went well:
- Great that we got to start using android studios in the first week

Even better if:
- The industry standards, Java recommendations, and best practices were
  highlighted in each lesson so we started forming the industry standard
  habits
- There was a designated quiet room for lab time. Instead of searching around
  the building for a quiet area to work on our lab assignments, it would be
  even better if we had one room to talk and one to work quietly (that was
  nearby)
- Our badge let us into the gym. One of the talks Mary gave was about taking
  care of our bodies so we don't get stressed. I believe it would help us all
  take care of ourselves if we had at least a discounted access to the gym
  on campus.
- The internet for the class was more robust; maybe our own modem/router.  
- Java was a prerequisite to starting the class so we could focus for 12 weeks on Android
- Our tuition included a subscription to SourceTree so we could go through the Android
  and Java tutorials along with the class material at our own pace
- There was a printer available to use in class. There are a lot of online resources, but
  some still prefer to read on paper, or to wireframe using paper prototypes
- We had a white board to write code on. Itâ€™s good to practice syntax without the 
  auto complete feature.
