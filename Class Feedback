Class Feedback

What went well:
- Great that we got to start using android studios in the first week

Even better if:
- The industry standards, Java recommendations, and best practices were
  highlighted in each lesson so we started forming the industry standard
  habits
- There was a designated quiet room for lab time. Instead of searching around
  the building for a quiet area to work on our lab assignments, it would be
  even better if we had one room to talk and one to work quietly (that was
  nearby)
- Our badge let us into the gym. One of the talks Mary gave was about taking
  care of our bodies so we don't get stressed. I believe it would help us all
  take care of ourselves if we had at least a discounted access to the gym
  on campus.
- The internet for the class was more robust; maybe our own modem/router.
