Class Feedback

What went well:
- Great that we got to start using android studios in the first week

Even better if:
- The industry standards, Java recommendations, and best practices were
  highlighted in each lesson so we started forming the industry standard
  habits
- There was a designated quiet room for lab time. Instead of searching around
  the building for a quiet area to work on our lab assignments, it would be
  even better if we had one room to talk and one to work quietly (that was
  nearby)
- Our badge let us into the gym. One of the talks Mary gave was about taking
  care of our bodies so we don't get stressed. I believe it would help us all
  take care of ourselves if we had at least a discounted access to the gym
  on campus.
- The internet for the class was more robust; maybe our own modem/router.  
- Java was a prerequisite to starting the class so we could focus for 12 weeks on Android
- Our tuition included a subscription to SourceTree so we could go through the Android
  and Java tutorials along with the class material at our own pace
- There was a printer available to use in class. There are a lot of online resources, but
  some still prefer to read on paper, or to wireframe using paper prototypes
- We had a white board to write code on. It’s good to practice syntax without the 
  auto complete feature.
- We were in a building where we didn’t have to hide when “guests” were here. It feels like the outreach building is ashamed of us and does not want us to be seen working in the lobby. See excerpt below from the weekly schedule:

“September 6 - September 9
Please be on campus at normal times this week - 9 am to 5 pm.
Be mindful that there are lots of events in our building this week. You will need to stay close to your room or sit outside - please don't be in the lobby.”
